Assigments of the [Coursera](http://www.coursera.org) course *Functional Programming Principles in Scala*.

This course is lectured by the inventor of Scala : [Martin Odersky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky). 
I took his other Scala course and proudly [accomplished with distinction](https://github.com/murphytalk/scala/blob/master/coursera.scala/course_certificate.pdf) :)
